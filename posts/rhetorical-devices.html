        <h1 class="h2 flash">Rhetorical Devices</h1>
        <div class="body-content">
            <p>A is B, A is like B, A is as B or comparing A with B. Head hurts. I know! The objective of this writing is to decipher the complexity of these rhetorical devices.</p>
            <p>This comparison game we play with analogy, simile and metaphor to enliven our ordinary communication. The rhetorical devices are paired up with logic to make sense of complex issues of the world.
            <p>Logic alone, though, cannot persuade an audience to believe what we are saying. Logic must work together with another discipline called rhetoric, or style, to communicate our ideas in a convincing way. Logic and rhetoric, moreover, are usually at odds with each other because the one appeals to our reason and the other to our emotions. How to orchestrate the creative forces of communication is the job before us.</p>
            <p>Let's explore some of the rhetorical devices — metaphor, simile and analogy which we use in our day-to-day communication. The meaning of three things are inconsistent from place to place. Using the first principles, we will compare the three rhetorical devices and then go deeper into metaphors.</p>
            <h4>Metaphors</h4>
            <p>A is B.
            <p>Metaphor, a literary technique, which originated from the Greek word metapherein meaning to transfer.</p>
            <p>A metaphor is a figure of speech that fuses two objects, resulting in a new entity that has characteristics of both. A metaphor states that one thing is another thing (A is B) but the two things are not strictly comparable.. A metaphor equates two things as one not because they are the same, but for the sake of comparison or symbolism.They can shed light on unfamiliar concepts and also provide humor.</p>
            <p>Take metaphor literally and you will find them very strange. For example, the *branches* of a family *tree* are not literal branches, but they have the same relationship to each other that real branches have to each other. The defining thing about a metaphor is that it is not literal.</p>
            <h4>Similes</h4>
            <p>A is like B, or A is as B.</p>
            <p>Simile, a literary technique, which originated form the Latin word similis meaning similar or like. The comparison will typically contain, like or as.</p>
            <p>A simile that compares two different things in order to create a new meaning. "like" and "as" are explicitly used when using simile. Simile is a type of metaphor just like sarcasm is a type of irony. For example, the world sucks my soul like a vampire drinks the blood of his victims or he is brave as a lion.</p>
            <p>A simile highlights a quality by comparing it to something else to make the thing stand out more vividly. 
            <h4>Analogy</h4>
            <p>Comparing A with B.</p>
            <p>Analogy, an argumentative technique, which originated from classical Latin analogia, meaning *ratio or proportion*.</p>
            <p>Analogy is comparable to metaphor and simile that it shows how two different things are similar. Analogy most often involves reference to something familiar or readily understood, in order to illustrate and explain something more complex and less readily understood. Rather than a figure of speech, analogy is a logical argument. One will use analogy to demonstrate how two things are alike by pointing out shared characteristics, with the goal of showing that if two things are similar in some ways, they are similar in other ways as well. The introduction of the analogy invites the brain to reuse existing knowledge about the 2nd thing in order to better understand the first thing.</p>
            <p>For example, if you live in the US and you've never heard of canton before, a helpful analogy to explain canton — "Cantons in Switzerland are *like* states in the USA." Here, cantons are analogous to states, and the comparison can help you understand an unfamiliar term.</p>
            <h4>Relationship Between The Three</h4>
            <p>Both the simile and the metaphor are figures of speech, and both operate by comparing the thing with something else in a figurative way (not literal). This is why the simile and the metaphor can be confusing. Whereas, an analogy is a logical device for argumentative purposes.</p>
            <p>A metaphor is almost always more forceful than an analogy, but you have to rely on the reader or listener's intuition to infer what you really mean. An analogy is clear and straightforward about what you mean, but it doesn't always have the same force as a metaphor, nor is it so easy to visualize.</p>
            <h4>Metaphors in Deep</h4>
            <p><i>“The greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor.”</i> — Aristotle</p>
            <p>Aristotle got it right! Metaphors are emotional. They are the fundamental language of poetry. They can make words come to life and ignite our understanding about the world.</p>
