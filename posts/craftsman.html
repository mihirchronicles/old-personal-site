        <div class="body-content">
            <p>A note on <i> becoming a craftsman.</i></p>
            <p>“What do you want to do with your life?” People are always asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer. Once you know the answer to the first question, then there is a follow-up question. “What are you good at?”</p>
            <p>This second question has been on my mind lately for a period of time. But, before I address the second question, let's briefly cover how to answer the first question. Everyone is given a plain canvas in their lives and it is up to them to create their masterpiece. Before you know what this masterpiece is going to be, you have to explore what options are available. </p>
            <p>Exploring these options can take several years, maybe a decade or two. If you want to be a doctor, go volunteer at a hospital. If you want to solve hunger, go visit an impowerish nation to experience what people go through living on dollar-a-day. Go take jobs in industries you think you may like. If you want to be an illustrator, explore great artists and work for them. In the process, you will run into demoralizing events. Friends and family will ask you to stay put at one job. Income is not sustainable during this exploratory period. You may think you just wasted 2 years working at a job you thought you liked. But fear not, these are all short-term hiccups. All these experiences will help you narrow down your choices, avoid what you don’t like and you will meet amazing people who are good at their own craft.</p>
            <p>Parents and schools rely on “aptitude” which are innate capabilities of a student. This is a bit misleading because aptitude does not present all options available to you. Instead, present yourself with some hard questions like “How can you unite people around the world?” or “What are the consequences of climate change on nature?” Then seek answers to those questions. Meet people in the field who are working on answering those questions. Note, it takes years to articulate great questions. Then they mold their aptitude with curiosity to help them answer the question “What do you want to do with your life?” In order to become a good craftsman, you have to be great at being curious.</p>
            <p>Now the follow-up question, “What are you good at?” Einstein, Shakespeare, Adam Smith, Henry Ford, Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper and so many more were all great craftsmen and craftswomen. Do you think Einstein was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to solve great mysteries of our universe? Of course not! He was having fun. That is why he was so good.</p>
            <p>In order to become a decent craftsman, you have to be great at being curious.</p>
            <p>Words like being persistent, diligent and rigorous are all synonymous to being a great craftsman. This requires so much cognitive power. The incremental progress is viewed as a sign of doing great work. Every detail counts. No task is too small when done together. Collective effort is applauded over individualism. Transparency is a key. Show your efforts publicly and receive feedback real time. These are all the characteristics of a great craftsman. </p>
