        <div class="body-content">
            <p>A note on <i> becoming a craftsman.</i></p>
            <p>“What do you want to do with your life?” People are always asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer. Once you know the answer to the first question, then there is a follow-up question. “What are you good at?”</p>
            <p>This second question has been on my mind lately for a period of time. But, before I address the second question, let's briefly cover how to answer the first question. Everyone is given a plain canvas in their lives and it is up to them to create their masterpiece. Before you know what this masterpiece is going to be, you have to explore what options are available to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Exploring your masterpiece</strong></p>
            <p>Exploring these options can take several years, maybe a decade or two. If you want to be a doctor, go volunteer at a hospital. If you want to solve hunger, go visit a developing nation to experience what people go through living on dollar-a-day. Go take jobs in industries you think you may like. If you want to be an art illustrator, explore great artists and work for them. In the process, you will run into demoralizing events. Friends and family will ask you to stay put at one job. Income will not be sustainable during this exploratory period. You may think you just wasted 2 years working at a job, you thought you liked. But fear not, these are all short-term hiccups. All these experimental experiences will help you narrow down your choices, avoid what you don’t like while you meet amazing people who are incredible at their own craft.</p>
            <p>Parents and schools rely on “aptitude” which is an innate ability of a student. This is a bit misleading because aptitude does not present all options available to you. Instead, present yourself with some hard questions like “How can you unite people around the world?” or “What are the consequences of climate change on nature?” Then seek answers to those questions. Meet people in the field who are working on answering those questions. Note, it will take years to articulate great questions. Then they mold their aptitude with curiosity to help them answer the question, “What do you want to do with your life?” In order to become a good craftsman, you have to be great at being curious.</p>
            <p><strong>Craftsmanship</strong></p>
            <p>Now the follow-up question, “What are you good at?” Einstein, Shakespeare, Adam Smith, Henry Ford, Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper and so many more were all great craftsmen and craftswomen. Do you think Einstein was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to solve great mysteries of our universe? Of course not! He was having fun. That is why he was so good. Fun is a key ingredient to be great at something. Fun is the only thing that will persist during obstacles.</p>
            <p>You can only have fun when you deeply care about what you are building. Don't mix caring deeply with being passionate. Passion is a loosely used term these days that people mix with what they are capable of. If you are 5 feet tall and are passionate about basketball, it does not mean your passion can lead you to be a pro basketball player. Know your competencies and when you are being dellusional. Craftsman know their limitations.</p>
            <p>Craftsman play a long game which is another key characteristic. The long game isn’t particularly notable and sometimes it is not even noticeable. It is boring. But when you choose to play the long game, the results can be extraordinary. The long game changes how you conduct your personal affairs. Doing what everyone else is doing pretty much ensures that you’re going to be average. But the longer you play the long game, the easier it is to play and the greater the rewards. </p>
            <p>Words like being persistent, diligent and rigorous are all synonymous to being a great craftsman because becoming great requires a lot of cognitive power. The incremental progress is viewed as a sign of doing great work. Every detail counts. No task is too small when done together. Collective effort is applauded over individualism. Be transparent. Show your efforts publicly and receive feedback real-time. Craftsman work hard but they also remember to take breaks and indulge in other activities where they find their inspiration from. These are all the characteristics of a great craftsman.</p>
